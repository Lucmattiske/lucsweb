            <br>

            <p1>
                My name is Luc and I am a young designer who has recently graduated with a <b>Bachelor of Design</b> at
                the <b>Australian National University.</b> This degree took a broad holistic approach to design which
                instead of specialising gives students a range of diverse design skills.

                This degree has provided me with a range of skills associated with both the industrial design area, as
                well as graphic design, UI, and design theory. I am very passionate about my personal art and creative
                practice as well as outdoor sports such as hiking, mountain biking, and snowboarding. I recently graduated, leaving a role on the visual team
                at the ANU Observer. Here I worked as a graphic designer with expectations of professional quality visuals with fast
                turnarounds. Jump into my projects, by hitting the projects tab at the top of the screen.
