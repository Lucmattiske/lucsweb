            <p1>
                Over my final Semester at ANU I worked at the ANU Observer as a graphic designer. In this role I
                produced
                graphics for use across the organisations website, instagram and facebook. This required expertise in
                Adobe
                Illustrator, Photoshop, and Indesign. During my time in this role I also worked to produce video
                coverage
                for ANU events including the BNO and ANU Theatre sports. <br> <br> <br>

                ‘Think Bee’ is an industrial microarchitecture brick that aims to provide key habitat to both burrowing
                and
                nesting bee species within urban residential environments. The project responds to a custom ‘reinventing
                the
                brick’ brief. I undertook this project as a part of my ANU capstone individual project.
                The project provided a system for randomised organic microterrain generation, within the space of the
                brick.
                The goal being to bring natural forms and habitats back into residential architectures. The projects
                final
                outcomes included, standard product renders, upscaled sculptural renders, and a physical material test,
                consisting of a fired cardboard clay material. <br> <br> <br>

                This was some work that I did for my capstone group project at the ANU. The project had us working with
                a
                client to produce a complete interior design redesign of the Griffith University Logan Student Centre.
                Our
                solution had to be catered to the theme of community and our group heavily focused on accessibility in
                the
                space.
                <br>
                Our final solution looked to connect with the Logan community through iconography of the local Grevillea
                flower. It took an open plan approach segregating eating and study areas, whilst simultaneously catering
                the
                space for community events. <br> <br> <br>

               The Air Aware system responded to a project brief requiring us to produce a socially active product able to engage with its environment through utilization of both inputs and outputs. We took on this brief utilising the Arduino physical computing system in combination with 3D printed parts. We decided to tackle the issue of decreasing air quality. Our system aimed to discretely monitor air quality data, and provide a website communication network through which this data could be communicated wirelessly.

The physical prototype is designed to discretely integrate under the bottom of a table so that it can be hidden from landlords. It monitors 5 different air quality inputs. See mockup for handheld alternative in the bottom right. <br> <br> <br>

                This product responded to a student led group brief which had us produce a product to tackle a wicked
                problem. We landed on the issue of a ‘Lack of Environmental Accessibility’ in urban rental spaces.
                <br>
                After an extensive interviewing and research process we found that renters lack the ability to own,
                maintain
                and keep green spaces in their homes. The Botanical Block system attacks this problem by providing a
                tile-able, stackable vertical gardening system geared for indoor spaces. The system is designed to
                efficiently integrate into indoors spaces, is highly portable, and low maintenance.

            <br>
            <p1>

                This chair responded to a design brief which asked students to ‘reveal a system of the unseen’. In order
                to
                respond to this brief I established a hypothetical client which would be the ‘Botanical Gardens
                Canberra’.
                The client goal was to reveal unseen elements of the forest environment for an exhibition event. My
                process
                targeted unseen mycelium structures that exist within the forest floor.
                <br>
                The work consisted of two parts: The legs, which represented the mycelium, and the seat being the
                mushroom
                cap itself. This was created by taking and processing real mycelium data, and transferring this into
                fusion
                to create 3d assets. The seat consisted of three leather pillow structures, constructed for comfort.

                fold, and the design was developed through a rapid prototyping process. It was designed to be
                constructed

                This is a poster which I made for the Randwick Cycling club to advertise a cycling event called ‘2024
                Retro
                Day’. In approaching this design I attempted to recreate a vintage cycling aesthetic. I utilised
                simplified
                colour blocks, a cool primary colour scheme, and graphic drawn elements. In terms of my typeface
                decisions,
                I decided to pair a decorative serif title font with a light geometric text option. See in yellow an
                earlier
                solution, and in blue the final solution adjusted to the clubs branding needs. <br> <br> <br>

                contributed logo and hat designs which were handed out to the riders. The ride aimed to raise money and
                awareness regarding the 2019 droughts which severely effected the income and lively hood of farmers in
                regional New South Wales. The event ended up raising $85000 which was given directly to regional
                community
                centres to help provide support networks to struggling local farmers.

                my design practise.
                <br>
                Works on the right responded to a brief which wanted us to create a socially active, tile-able product
                prototype . We were to present this using a series of models and 2 point perspective drawings.
                <br>
                I ended up producing a design for a skatepark, aiming at creating positive recreational facilities for
                kids
                in urban communities. As curves cannot be accurately produced using perspective drawings, we were told
                to
                map them with precise segments.<br> <br> <br>

                This group project comes from a brief which had us producing a working scale habitat for an endangered
                species of local Canberra birds. Our species was the ‘gang gang’ cockatoo, an iconic local Canberra bird
                that is losing breeding habitat due to urbanisation and sprawl.
                <br>
                Our goal was to reintegrate this bird back into the urban environments of canberra cities by creating a
                nesting environment built to be attached to houses and buildings. The design we landed was made to
                integrate
                with the aesthetics of local canberra architecture. The product was constructed from strong insulating
                decking wood, and featured a soft interior perfect for nesting.<br> <br> <br>

                The dynamic ID project, had us utilizising the P5js Coding software to develop a range of Visual
                Branding
                Assets for a custom brief. Our group decided to produce a new identity for the Canberra international
                Music
                Festival, taking architectural data from concert locations, and forming interpretive designs and
                patterns
                related to this.
                <br>
                From this we were able to produce a unique set of variable ticket designs which changed depending on the
                music genre and location of the events.
                <br>

                In this project our brief had us designing an entirely new brand image for the local Downer cafe ‘Gang
                Gang’.
                <br>
                My take on the brief was that I felt the cafe need to integrate the younger crowd that visited the cafe
                at
                night for live music gigs, with the older audience who visited commonly during the day. I ended up doing
                this by creating a lighthearted blend which mixed 60-70’s style cartoon print techniques and photography
                commically with iconic Aussie punk rock scene aesthetics and imagery, creating a fun parodied
                combination.<br> <br> <br>
