                        <p1>
                            During my final semester at ANU, I served as a graphic designer for the ANU Observer. In
                            collaboration with the Visual Team, I produced content for the campus newspaper, utilizing
                            Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create and format graphics for both online publications
                            and social media promotion. Each week, our team leader assigned three graphic briefs via
                            Slack, each with a two-day deadline to ensure timely news coverage. A significant aspect of
                            my role involved presenting innovative ideas related to web design, merchandise, and social
                            media content during our weekly team meetings. Additionally, as a member of the Visual Team,
                            I contributed to event coverage by working backstage at campus events such as Theatre Sports
                            and Big Night Out. My responsibilities included producing promotional materials, assisting
                            with setup, photographing events, operating video cameras, and assisting live streaming.
                            Throughout my experience at the Observer, I excelled in a collaborative environment,
                            effectively meeting tight deadlines while passionately representing the Observer brand
                            through high-quality visual content.<br> <br> <br>

                            “Think Bee” is an innovative industrial microarchitecture brick designed to provide
                            essential habitats for both burrowing and nesting bee species within urban residential
                            environments. This project was developed in response to a custom brief focused on
                            “reinventing the brick” as part of my capstone individual project at ANU. The initiative
                            features a system for randomized organic microterrain generation within the brick’s
                            structure, aiming to reintroduce natural forms and habitats into residential architecture.
                            The final outcomes of the project included standard product renders, upscale sculptural
                            renders, and a physical material test utilizing a fired cardboard clay material.

                            This work was part of my capstone group project at ANU, where we collaborated with a client
                            to completely redesign the interior of the Griffith University Logan Student Centre. Our
                            solution centered around the theme of community, with a strong emphasis on accessibility
                            within the space. Our final design aimed to connect with the Logan community through the
                            incorporation of local Grevillea flower iconography. We adopted an open-plan approach that
                            effectively segregated eating and study areas while also accommodating the space for
                            community events.

                            inputs and outputs. We utilized the Arduino physical computing system in conjunction with
                            3D-printed components to address the pressing issue of declining air quality. Our system
                            discreetly monitors air quality data and establishes a wireless communication network that
                            relays this information via a dedicated website. This approach ensures effective
                            dissemination of critical air quality information to the community.

                            This project was developed in response to a student-led group brief that challenged us to
                            address a complex, "wicked" problem. Our team focused on the issue of environmental
                            accessibility in urban rental spaces.
                            <br> <br>
                            Through extensive research and interviews, we discovered that renters often face challenges
                            in owning, maintaining, and incorporating green spaces within their homes. In response, we
                            designed the Botanical Block System—a modular, stackable vertical garden specifically
                            created for indoor environments.
                            <br> <br>
                            The system is highly portable, low-maintenance, and integrates seamlessly into small urban
                            spaces, offering renters a practical solution for bringing nature into their homes.

                            This chair was designed in response to a brief asking students to "reveal an unseen system."
                            I developed a concept for a hypothetical client, Botanical Gardens Canberra, with the aim of
                            unveiling hidden elements of the forest environment for an exhibition.
                            <br><br>
                            My design highlights the unseen mycelium networks that exist beneath the forest floor. The
                            chair is composed of two key elements: the legs, which symbolize the intricate mycelium
                            structures, and the seat, representing the mushroom cap.
                            <br><br>
                            Using real mycelium data, I generated 3D assets in Fusion 360 to accurately reflect these
                            natural patterns. The seat features three leather cushions, designed for both comfort and
                            aesthetic appeal, merging functionality with a narrative of nature's hidden systems.

                        <p1>
                            For this brief, I was tasked with creating a unique stool design. My approach was to craft a
                            sleek, industrial modern aesthetic, drawing inspiration from the Bauhaus movement,
                            specifically the iconic Wassily Chair.
                            <br><br>
                            The form of the stool was influenced by the clean, geometric lines of a paper Z-fold, and
                            the design evolved through a rapid prototyping process. The final product is intended to be
                            constructed from bent steel tubing paired with a leather cushion, combining minimalist style
                            with functional comfort. <br>

                        <p1>
                            This poster was designed for the Randwick Cycling Club to promote their ‘2024 Retro Day’
                            event. My goal was to capture a vintage cycling aesthetic, combining nostalgic elements with
                            modern design principles.
                            <br><br>
                            To achieve this, I utilized simplified color blocks and a cool primary color scheme,
                            complemented by hand-drawn graphic elements. In terms of typography, I paired a decorative
                            serif font for the title with a light geometric font for body text, creating a balanced yet
                            dynamic look.
                            <br><br>
                            The poster evolved through multiple iterations: the yellow version represents an earlier
                            concept, while the blue version reflects the final solution, which was tailored to meet the
                            club’s branding requirements. <br> <br>

                            In 2019, I contributed to the design efforts for The Drought Ride, a charity cycling event
                            held in Cabonne Country, New South Wales. My role involved designing the event logo and
                            creating hat designs, which were distributed to the participants.
                            <br><br>
                            The event was organized to raise awareness and funds in response to the severe droughts that
                            heavily impacted the livelihood of farmers in the region. The Drought Ride successfully
                            raised $85,000, which was donated directly to regional community centers, providing
                            essential support networks for struggling local farmers.

                            In early 2024, I completed a freelance project in collaboration with the Old Canberra Inn
                            (OCI), a historic craft beer institution located in Canberra. The client sought to reflect
                            the building’s history as an old highway stop, using heritage Australian color palettes to
                            evoke a sense of nostalgia.
                            <br><br>
                            For the logo, I focused on emphasizing the OCI initials to appeal to a younger audience
                            while addressing the challenge of maintaining a connection to the full name, Old Canberra
                            Inn. I selected Century Gothic as the primary typeface, drawing inspiration from the
                            Victorian neogothic period in which the establishment was founded, while incorporating
                            vintage-style emphasis strokes to enhance historical ties.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to the logo, I developed supporting assets, including a Gang-gang cockatoo
                            illustration and a simplified representation of the building’s façade, further integrating
                            the rich history of the location into the brand identity.

                        <br>
                        <p1>
                            In my final semester at ANU, I collaborated with the Canberra Museum and Gallery (CMAG) to
                            design and implement a public program. The project focused on two key themes: fostering
                            connections within the Canberra community and improving wayfinding from Canberra Centre to
                            the museum. We aimed to address the challenge of limited foot traffic in the area by
                            creating an engaging and intriguing experience.
                            <br><br>
                            Our program featured a stall with interactive activities, where participants were invited to
                            express how Canberra made them feel by writing down their thoughts on paper. To enhance
                            engagement, we introduced a tactile component, encouraging visitors to represent their
                            feelings physically. Additionally, we set up a chalk drawing station at the base of the hill
                            and created a drawn pathway leading directly to the stall, which was located at the museum’s
                            entrance.
                            <br><br>
                            The initiative was successful in attracting a diverse audience, particularly families and
                            individuals looking for a fun, creative activity on a Saturday afternoon. This approach
                            effectively increased foot traffic to the gallery, drawing in visitors who were encouraged
                            to explore the exhibition spaces after participating in the outdoor activities.

                            During my second year at university, I completed a course that equipped me with
                            industry-standard skills in precise modeling, isometric drawing, and perspective drawing.
                            These skills have become integral to my design practice and continue to influence my work.
                            <br><br>
                            The projects displayed on the right were developed in response to a brief that tasked us
                            with creating a socially active, tile-able product prototype. We were required to present
                            our concepts through a series of models and two-point perspective drawings.
                            <br><br>
                            I chose to design a skatepark, focusing on the development of positive recreational
                            facilities for children in urban communities. This experience not only honed my technical
                            skills but also reinforced the importance of thoughtful design in enhancing community
                            engagement and providing accessible recreational spaces.

                            The Dynamic ID project involved utilizing P5.js coding software to create a variety of
                            visual branding assets for a custom brief. Our group chose to develop a new identity for the
                            Canberra International Music Festival, using architectural data from concert locations to
                            inspire interpretive designs and patterns.
                            <br><br>
                            This approach enabled us to produce a distinctive set of variable ticket designs that
                            changed based on the music genre and location of each event. The result was a visually
                            engaging ticketing system that reflected the unique character of the festival.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, I developed an unrelated infinite terrain generator using the same software,
                            showcasing my ability to leverage coding for creative applications.

                            This group project was developed in response to a brief requiring us to design a
                            working-scale habitat for an endangered local species, the Gang-gang cockatoo. This iconic
                            bird is facing habitat loss due to urbanization and sprawl in the Canberra region.
                            <br><br>
                            Our objective was to reintegrate the Gang-gang cockatoo into urban environments by creating
                            a nesting solution that could be attached to houses and buildings. We focused on a design
                            that harmonized with the aesthetics of local Canberra architecture, ensuring it complemented
                            the surrounding environment.
                            <br><br>
                            The final product was constructed from durable, insulating decking wood, featuring a soft
                            interior designed specifically for nesting. This initiative aimed to promote biodiversity
                            and support the preservation of this beloved species within the urban landscape.

                            In this project, the brief tasked us with creating a new brand image for the local Downer
                            café, Gang Gang.
                            <br><br>
                            My approach focused on bridging the gap between the younger crowd that frequented the café
                            at night for live music gigs and the older audience that visited during the day. I achieved
                            this by developing a lighthearted blend of design elements, combining 1960s-70s cartoon
                            print techniques and photography with aesthetics and imagery from the iconic Australian punk
                            rock scene. The result was a playful, parodic combination that appealed to both
                            demographics, looking to foster a vibrant and inclusive atmosphere for the café.
